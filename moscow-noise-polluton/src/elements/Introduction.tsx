                I am 22 years old now, and only recently I realized that all these years
                I have been living in a constant noise.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a child, I used to live near the airport, and everyday I watched and heard planes landing.
                They flew just above the building, including the one I lived in, and looked like giant birds
                targeting their nest. Needless to say that I was mostly amused with them. Meanwhile, my town
                was growing. When I was five, my area was the outskirts. By the time I became ten, my area got
                surrounded by new buildings that enlarged the town approximately by a third. It all happened in
                a blink of an eye (as it seemed to me) or in a few years of pile driving, escalators operating
                and dump trucks unloading (as it truly was). As a teenager, I mostly ignored these processes
                and noise — I was busy with my own challenges.

                Studying at university, I moved to Moscow. Even though I live near the Leningradskoe highway,
                which heads to Sheremetyevo airport, planes do not either amuse or bother my anymore: they are
                prohibited to enter Moscow’s space. However, building processes are still present: new offices
                are being built just next to my apartment block, so, every day I have a ‘pleasure’ to wake up
                with trucks beeping and piles driving, just as I used to do at my hometown. Moreover, new sounds
                of urban nature occurred. Though Leningradskoe highway is a few blocks away from my opened window,
                car noise manages to cover this distance. Needless to say that some of my neighbors have dogs barking,
                others adore night parties, and some strangers on the street are constantly loosing each other and
                shout to meet back.

                That is just one story of a person who lives in an urban area, and it shows that noise is everywhere.
                In own modern world silence becomes a rare commodity now, and that is not beneficial for a human
                physical and mental well-being. A situation when sounds of surrounding nature start bothering,
                irritate or disturb, not matter how loud and irritating they are, is a <strong>noise pollution</strong>.
