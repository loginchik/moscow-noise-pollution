            <h2>Noise threats</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike air or water pollution, noise pollution is invisible and in many cases is not even recognized
                as pollution. Sounds of urban nature are often taken for granted: without cars there would be no
                transportation possible, without construction sites there would be no place for living, without
                airports and planes many global processes and international cooperation would be impossible.
                These sounds may considered as a price that townspeople pay to use the benefits of city life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, noise pollution is considered to be any unwanted or disturbing sound that affects physical
                or mental well-being of a person. Not every sound is polluting, as noise has a  psychological component
                — circumstances that make a sound unwanted. Negative mental effect, which
                noise has, originates from person’s perception of what is being listened and their attitude to the
                disturbing element of a nature. For instance, people at a rock concert do not evaluate — sometimes
                unbearably loud — music as noise: this music is a key part of an event they paid to get to, they are
                mostly likely to be fans of a band playing and, in general, enjoy. Yet, people living near the concert
                hall might evaluate the same event as noise pollution because it may be loud enough to disturb their
                working process or attempt to relax, to wake children up or to prevent them from falling asleep.
                The same loud event is thought of differently due to the contrast of perceptions of those who came
                to the rock concert voluntarily and those who are forced to witness it.

                Sounds that reach 85 decibels or higher can harm a person’s hearing. Yet, they appear on a daily basis:
                lawn movers buzz at a volume of 65-95 decibels in every park during from
                late spring until early autumn, subway trains arrive at a station with a sound may exceed 100 decibels,
                neighbors electric drill tries to break though the wall at 95 decibels… In a short run loud sounds
                can lead to temporary hearing loss, while long-term consequences of noise pollution may affect both
                physical and mental well-being of a person, beyond hearing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Back in 2011, WHO published summarized evidence on the relationship between environmental noise and
                health effects, indicating that noise pollution leads to annoyance, sleep disturbance and
                cardiovascular disease. Authors used Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) to evaluate the affect
                of noise on West Europeans’ health.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                DALY is a special metric that allows to compare the consequences of different disease on human life.
                Calculated as Years of Life Lost (YLL) +  Years Lived with Disability (YLD), it shows how many years
                human or society loses due to diseases, injuries or unfavorable environmental factors.

                Sleep disturbance is the most crucial consequence of noise pollution, as it leads to 903 thousands
                of DALY yearly. Human auditory system has a watchman function that constantly monitors the environment
                for threats, even during the sleep period. When the noise penetrates into bedroom, it postpones the
                moment a person falls asleep, can wake them up during the night and can prevent the blood pressure
                from going down during the night. All these micro-awakening, leading to fragmented sleep structure,
                and organism reactions to the general stress result in deterioration in sleep quality. Simply,
                next morning one can wake up already feeling exhausted.

                Annoyance, even though it is hardly measurable in quantitative research, is noted as the second most
                significant affect of noise pollution. Every year about 654 thousands of DALY are caused by it,
                affecting the majority of population and driving them into additional stress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Traffic noise, especially in the early morning, can increase the probability of coronary heart disease
                and hypertension, leading to 61 thousands DALY yearly. Noise, which is impossible to turn off or to
                control in any other way, is a stress for a person — in response to it, body excretes stress hormones
                that lead to changes in the composition of blood. This and other factors, as studies show, in some
                cases lead to high blood pressure, heart attacks and stroke.

                Exposed near schools or living areas, traffic noise affects the cognitive functions of children and
                impairs their concentration and memory, affecting thousands of children aged 4-19 and resulting in 45
                thousands of DALY. Other studies have found that children who attend schools in noise areas are more
                likely to lag behind their peers in academic performance.

            <blockquote>
                In total noise pollution steals more than a 1 million years of healthy life from Western Europeans
                every year.

                The problem of noise regulations lays in the fact that many of the activities that generate noise also
                generate revenue, and the economics would fail, if strict noise regulations are applied.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2022, WHO released the target levels of exposure from the most crucial sources of noise.
                The suggested regulations are divided in national and community level of implementation,
                indicating that both government and society should address the noise pollution to improve the sound
                environment. On the one side, the politicians need to introduce new regulations and support the
                infrastructure development; on the other side, businesses and civilians should participate in
                technological progress, inventing new ways to lower the sound of most used devices and items,
                such as transport and household items, so that in general the environment would become quieter.

                Some of the recommendations seem hardly achievable in modern densely built-up cities as they require
                a major infrastructure redesign. Yet, as Moscow’s history shows, even the airport removal — which is
                a option of flight paths rearranging — is possible. The decision to build an airport on Khodynka Field,
                in the north area of a city, was made in 1910 — at the very dawn of aviation era —
                by the Aeronautics Society and the Moscow
                Military District. In 1922, after serving its first civil flight from Moscow to Königsberg, the airport
                became international and kept this status until the plane crash in 1935. Since then, only the service
                and tests flights were conducted on the spot. Still, planes took off and landed within the city boarders,
                exposing noise of more than 100 decibels[^noise-awareness-day-levels]. However, the airport remained
                the center of aircraft construction and development, as numerous research and design organizations
                were located nearby. The final decision to get rid of an airport was made only in 2003.
                After a decade of unknown status, the area gained local authorities’ interest. By now, the airport
                building has beed replaced with Aviapark — the biggest shopping mall in Europe, landing strips have
                been erased and replaced with a recreation area.
