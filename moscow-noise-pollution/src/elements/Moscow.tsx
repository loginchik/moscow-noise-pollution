                The Khodynka airport would be hardly possible to function in accordance with modern Moscow’s law of
                silence as it protects citizens against disturbance of their piece and quiet. The general rule it
                that it is prohibited to expose loud sounds in living areas, hospitals, hotels and other resting areas,
                near schools during the night — from 11 p.m till 7 a.m, — at weekends and on holidays.
                The forbidden actions include playing musical instruments, turning on high volume on TV, shouting,
                use of pyrotechnics, repair, construction, loading and unloading works. Additionally, the law prohibits
                repair works from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. and from 7 p.m. until 9 a.m.

                <summary>About the data</summary>
                <p>
                    The key source are the results of noise level monitoring on data from mobile environmental
                    laboratories, which is publicly available on the Moscow government open data portal.
                    This data contains result of noise level monitoring that has been conducted in response
                    to citizens complains about the noise.

            <p>
                In 2024, Muscovites reported on the noise 865 times in total, and 214 times of them were proved by
                the mobile monitoring results. By the end of August, this year citizens complained about the noise
                771 times in total (64% percents more than previous year), and same 214 times were proved violating
                noise regulations by the mobile monitoring results.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most frequent noise reason that dominates in both periods is construction work. In 2025, citizens
                complained about the loud sounds coming from the construction sites 533 times. 30% of the monitoring
                results recorded the noise regulations violations, 38% disapproved the complains and in remaining 32%
                cases mobile monitoring did not manage to locate the noise source (and to evaluate the level of noise
                it exposes) as it was not present on the spot at the time monitoring arrived.

                Other top reasons to report the noise are
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    generator sets: 63 reports by the end of August, 53% of monitoring attempts did not manage
                    to locate the noise source,
                </li>
                <li>
                    loading and unloading operations: 41 times, 87% of monitoring attempts did not manage
                    to locate the noise source,
                </li>
                <li>
                    road repair works: 25 times, 92% of monitoring attempts did not manage to locate the noise source,
                </li>
                <li>
                    motor transport noise: 21 times,  90% of mobile monitoring results proved noise regulations
                    violation,
                </li>
                <li>
                    other repair works: 16 times, 88% of monitoring attempts did not manage to locate the noise source,
                    none of results proved the violations,
                </li>
                <li>
                    railway transport: 6 times, 67% of monitoring results proved noise regulations violation.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Even though most of the noise reports, which were proved by the mobile monitoring in 2025, came from
                eastern and south-eastern areas of Moscow, the pollutants spill all around the city. Explore them mapped:

                Some of noise sources are temporary. For instance, construction site or road repair spot, same as
                cultural events and sports matches, may expose extremely loud sounds, but disappear as soon as the
                construction or repair is finished.

                In contrast, motor traffic, railway transport, manufactory, airplanes or underground are hard to
                relocate — to address these noise pollutants, local authorities need to adapt the existing regulations.
                Noteworthy, Moscow legislation complies with WHO recommendations. Trucks are strictly limited to
                enter the city during the day. The overall speed of motor traffic in the center of the city is lowered
                by 50 kilometers per hour; though the measure addresses the accident rate, it also reduces
                the noise pollution in the area. In February, local authorities announced a major noise reduction
                barriers repair — such constructions absorb the sound coming from the traffic, making the environment
                quieter in the guarded area.
