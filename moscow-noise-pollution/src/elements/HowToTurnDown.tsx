                How to turn the noise down

                Even though the noise pollution is inevitable, there are steps that a person can take to reduce its
                impact on their well-being. Noise reduction at the source makes the most sense.

                    Step 0. Identify the noise
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tip: it gets too loud when you need to change your behavior
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you need to raise your voice to be understood, or increase the volume of TV set, or want
                    to avoid outside areas, or close the window because of the outside sounds, that is a sign that
                    loud is getting too loud.

                    In case you have enough money or space:
                </p>
                <p>
                    option 1. Move to a less noise area, which may be located outside of the city
                </p>
                <p>
                    option 2. Move the bedroom to the quiet space of the current house or apartment — let the building
                    shift you from the noise coming though the open window, especially at night
                </p>

                    In general:
                </p>
                <p>
                    option 1. Make low noise a priority when choosing a new apartment to live in. Visit the property
                    during the different times of a day and talk to neighbors about the local sound environment
                </p>
                <p>
                    option 2. Make low noise a priority when choosing a new household item to buy. Many manufacturers
                    advertise their items and quiet — consider the information when making the final choice
                </p>
                <p>
                    option 3. Wear noise cancelling headphones while being in noisy environment: during the flights or
                    train rides, even in the office filled with irritating background sounds
                </p>
                <p>
                    option 4. Seek out quiet spaces, especially on the weekend or during the vacation. Even one walk
                    in a local park can help your organism to wind down and rest
                </p>
                <p>
                    option 5. Care about your neighbors and ask them to care about you back: do not start noisy
                    household duties, such as vacuuming or drilling, early in the morning
                </p>
