                As a&nbsp;child, I used to&nbsp;live near the&nbsp;airport, and&nbsp;everyday I watched and&nbsp;heard planes landing.
                They flew just above the&nbsp;buildings, including the&nbsp;one I lived&nbsp;in, and&nbsp;looked like giant birds
                targeting their&nbsp;nest. Needless to&nbsp;say that I&nbsp;was mostly amused with&nbsp;them. Meanwhile, my&nbsp;town
                was growing. When I&nbsp;was five, my&nbsp;area was the&nbsp;outskirts. By&nbsp;the&nbsp;time I became ten, my&nbsp;area got
                surrounded by&nbsp;new&nbsp;buildings that enlarged the&nbsp;town approximately by&nbsp;a&nbsp;third. It all happened
                in&nbsp;a&nbsp;blink of&nbsp;an&nbsp;eye (as it seemed to&nbsp;me) or in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few years of&nbsp;pile driving,
                escalators operating and&nbsp;dump trucks unloading (as it truly&nbsp;was). As a&nbsp;teenager, I mostly ignored these&nbsp;processes
                and&nbsp;noise — I was&nbsp;busy with&nbsp;my&nbsp;own challenges.

                Studying at&nbsp;university, I moved to&nbsp;Moscow. Even&nbsp;though I live near&nbsp;the&nbsp;Leningradskoe highway,
                which heads to&nbsp;Sheremetyevo airport, planes do&nbsp;not either&nbsp;amuse or&nbsp;bother me&nbsp;anymore:
                they are&nbsp;prohibited to&nbsp;enter Moscow’s&nbsp;space. However, building processes are&nbsp;still present:
                new&nbsp;offices are being&nbsp;built just next&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;apartment block, so, every day I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;‘pleasure’ to&nbsp;wake&nbsp;up
                with&nbsp;trucks beeping and piles driving, just&nbsp;as&nbsp;I used to&nbsp;do at&nbsp;my&nbsp;hometown. Moreover, new&nbsp;sounds
                of&nbsp;urban nature occurred. Though Leningradskoe highway is&nbsp;a&nbsp;few blocks away,
                car noise manages to&nbsp;cover this&nbsp;distance. Needless to&nbsp;say that some&nbsp;of&nbsp;my&nbsp;neighbors have dogs barking,
                others adore night parties, and some strangers on&nbsp;the&nbsp;street are constantly loosing each&nbsp;other and
                shout to&nbsp;meet&nbsp;back.

                That is&nbsp;just one&nbsp;story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person who&nbsp;lives in&nbsp;an&nbsp;urbanized area, and it&nbsp;shows
                that noise&nbsp;is&nbsp;everywhere. In&nbsp;our&nbsp;modern world silence becomes a&nbsp;rare&nbsp;commodity,
                and that is&nbsp;not&nbsp;beneficial for&nbsp;a&nbsp;human physical and mental well-being.
                A&nbsp;situation when sounds of&nbsp;surrounding nature start bothering, irritate or disturb,
                no&nbsp;matter how&nbsp;loud and&nbsp;irritating they&nbsp;are, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>noise pollution</strong>.
